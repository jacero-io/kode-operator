                              FailOpen is a switch used to control the behavior when a response from the External Authorization service cannot be obtained.
                              If FailOpen is set to true, the system allows the traffic to pass through.
                              Otherwise, if it is set to false or not set (defaulting to false),
                              the system blocks the traffic and returns a HTTP 5xx error, reflecting a fail-closed approach.
                              This setting determines whether to prioritize accessibility over strict security in case of authorization service failure.

                              FailOpen is a switch used to control the behavior when a response from the External Authorization service cannot be obtained.
                              If FailOpen is set to true, the system allows the traffic to pass through.
                              Otherwise, if it is set to false or not set (defaulting to false),
                              the system blocks the traffic and returns a HTTP 5xx error, reflecting a fail-closed approach.
                              This setting determines whether to prioritize accessibility over strict security in case of authorization service failure.
